# Monorepo Project

This project is a monorepo setup using Yarn workspaces. It includes:

- A React.js frontend
- A Python backend for AI and dataset pipeline
- A JavaScript backend using Express.js or Next.js
- Integration with Langchain for AI chat and RAG features to analyze and chat with PDF files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Yarn
- Python

### Initial Setup

1. **Initialize the Monorepo**

   Create a new directory and initialize it with a `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   mkdir ai-project
   cd ai-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Set Up Yarn Workspaces**

  Add the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

  ```json
  {
    "private": true,
    "workspaces": [
      "packages/*"
    ],
    "scripts": {
      "start:frontend": "yarn workspace frontend start",
      "start:backend-python": "yarn workspace backend-python start",
      "start:backend-js": "yarn workspace backend-js start",
      "start": "concurrently \"yarn start:frontend\" \"yarn start:backend-python\" \"yarn start:backend-js\""
    }
  }
  ```

3. **Add Packages**

Create directories for each part of your project:

```bash
mkdir -p packages/frontend
mkdir -p packages/backend-python
mkdir -p packages/backend-js
```

4. **Set Up the Frontend**

Navigate to the frontend package and set up a React.js project:

```bash
cd packages/frontend
npx create-react-app .
```

5. **Set Up the Backend (Python)**

Navigate to the backend-python package and set up a Python project:

```bash
cd ../backend-python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Set Up the Backend (JavaScript)**

Navigate to the backend-js package and set up an Express.js or Next.js project:

```bash
cd ../backend-js
npm init -y
npm install express
```


7. **Set up Next-js**

```bash
$ cd packages
$ npx create-next-app@latest next-js
```


8. **Configure Yarn Workspaces**

Ensure all dependencies are linked correctly. Add the following to your root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

8. **Install Dependencies**

Run Yarn to install all dependencies and link the packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

9. **Run the Project**

Use the scripts defined in the root package.json to start your project:

```bash
yarn start
```

This setup should give you a working monorepo project with a React.js frontend, Python backend for AI and data processing, and a JavaScript backend using Express.js or Next.js. Integrate Langchain for AI chat and RAG features for PDF analysis as needed.



### Summary

By following these steps and configurations, youâ€™ll have a robust and maintainable monorepo setup that integrates JavaScript and Python projects efficiently. This approach ensures a consistent development environment and simplifies the management of multiple services within a single repository.
